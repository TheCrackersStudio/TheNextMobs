## 🧠 Design Philosophy  
This isn’t a “remake.” It’s an **evolution**.  
Each mob is reworked with the same design logic Mojang has used in newer mobs. more expressive faces, cleaner palettes, and subtle lighting.  
The goal: make the world feel **cohesive** without breaking its vanilla soul.

- Works with **any vanilla-based resource pack**  
- Safe for **servers and multiplayer**  
- Optimized for **performance** and **clarity**
